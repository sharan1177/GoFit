Taking out some time from your busy schedule to attend a gym daily for a workout seems difficult for working professionals & college students due to workload & studies. As a result of which many people prefer doing exercises or gym workouts at their home itself. However, a gym workout or exercise done without following the right procedure or positions and done without the proper guidance of a trainer can damage your muscles. Also, hiring a personal trainer may not fit everyone’s budget.
             So, to tackle this issue we have developed an android based application called GoFit which will act as a virtual trainer. This application will guide the users on various body exercises with step-by-step positions, diet plan according to user’s preference and a reminder feature to set the time for food intake.
